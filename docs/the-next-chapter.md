The Next Chapter: Transition and Mentoring Programme for Year 7

Starting secondary school is an exciting step but it can also be challenging. Students face new teachers, classrooms, subjects, and responsibilities. For some, this change can create social pressures and make it harder to settle in or feel confident.

The Next Chapter helps students navigate these challenges by giving them the skills and support they need to engage fully in school and have the best start possible. We do this through fun, active sessions and sport-based activities that encourage teamwork, communication, and social connection.



Our Approach

Trusted Mentor Support
Each student is paired with a mentor who becomes a consistent, supportive adult during the transition. Mentors provide guidance, reassurance, and help students feel safe, understood, and valued within the school community.

Activities and Sport
Team games and active challenges give students opportunities to:

practice communication skills

work together with peers

develop friendships and social confidence

experience success and build self-esteem in a supportive environment

Guided Mentoring and Reflection
Through structured conversations and reflection, students learn to:

navigate new social situations

maintain meaningful friendships

manage social pressures and responsibilities

express themselves confidently



Why The Next Chapter Helps

Starting secondary school brings new social expectations and responsibilities. Students must navigate:

larger peer groups and changing friendship dynamics

increased independence and personal responsibility

unfamiliar routines and rules

social pressures that can affect confidence and engagement

Friendships in secondary school are especially important because they shape a student’s overall school experience and can influence their future social and emotional development. Positive friendships help students feel safe, included, and confident, while supportive peer relationships can make the difference between a negative experience and a positive, fulfilling school life.

The Next Chapter uses activities and sport to teach these essential skills in a practical, enjoyable way. This helps students build meaningful friendships, feel included, and remain engaged in school.



What Students Gain

stronger friendships and social connections

improved communication skills

greater confidence and self-esteem

better emotional regulation

a sense of belonging and security in secondary school

By focusing on social skills, confidence, and friendship through activities and sport, The Next Chapter helps students engage fully in school and start secondary education on a positive, supported path that can shape their future well-being.
