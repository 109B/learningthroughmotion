Sensory Sessions – Sundays

Our Sensory Development Sessions support children who are not neurotypical by working closely in line with their EHCP goals. Each session focuses on helping children achieve the aims of their individual plan through fun, flexible, and engaging activities that develop sensory processing, motor skills, and emotional regulation.

We work on key sensory areas such as:

Proprioception – helping children understand where their bodies are in space and develop coordination

Interoception – helping children recognise and respond to internal body signals such as hunger, thirst, and fatigue
