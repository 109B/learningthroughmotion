> “Learning Through Motion has been a fantastic addition to our school. They work closely with me to understand what we are focusing on in class and then plan practical, engaging sessions that support our children with SEN.  
>
> Their sensory-based activities not only meet the pupils’ sensory needs but also help them maintain attention, regulate themselves, and retain key information.  
>
> The children absolutely love their sessions and look forward to them each week. It has been wonderful to see how much confidence and enjoyment the pupils gain from Learning Through Motion. Robbie and Julian are professional, thoughtful, and genuinely committed to supporting every child. I can’t recommend them highly enough.”

> “The sessions were engaging and fun. The children made great progress and learned without even realising. The staff supported the children to be resilient and taught them so many new skills. I would recommend Learning Through Motion to any school who want support inclusion.”

> “I took my son for two sessions in November and he loved it. Robbie and Julian were very understanding with his needs and did not pressure him. They let him be himself.  
>
> They come round and talk to the parents and also take time to play with the children. I would definitely recommend.”

> “Hi guys. I just wanted to say a big thank you for having D at the sessions. He loved them. They give him freedom without intense structure, which allows him to be himself.  
>
> He feels included, which is amazing for him. He loves the games, especially throwing balls at a wall and catching them in nets.  
>
> It has also been lovely for me as a SEN parent to be around other parents who understand and don’t have unrealistic expectations of my child. We will definitely be at the next sessions. Thank you for everything you do.”
