# Project Log

## 2024-03-17
- Reinforced colour-forward styling for programme cards so each strand keeps its original accessible palette accents.
- Created this log file to capture future instructions/changes per user request.

- Added skip navigation, quick links, and accordion layouts to improve UX/UI without removing any copy.
- Introduced multi-column prose styles and reorganised sections to ease scanning while preserving the full text content.
- Rebuilt the primary navigation with a dropdown programme menu and persistent CTA for improved hierarchy and accessibility.
- Tweaked header alignment styles so the primary menu and CTA line up consistently across breakpoints.
- Simplified the menu (no dropdown) and introduced a visually accessible programme strip so SEND audiences have fewer cognitive steps.
- Reimagined the hero: logo-led intro on the left, and a clear “What we deliver / Our approach” pillar card on the right for a calmer launch experience.
- Softened the palette (lighter background, clay header gradient) and enlarged the hero logo/cards for a more natural, accessible first impression.
- Reverted the clay header, removed the logo tile, enlarged the mark, and added active states to the programme strip to keep navigation clarity while keeping the surface mostly white.
- Reintroduced the clay gradient across the header/submenu with high-contrast white nav, so the top chrome signals location while the rest of the page stays light.
- Updated the palette to match the original site’s navy/sand tones and swapped the body font to Atkinson Hyperlegible for better readability.
- Darkened the header gradient, added a subtle background behind the logo block, and tightened the nav/pill styling so the top chrome is easier to read and aligned.
