---

## Proposed Improvements (Priority Order)

### 1. Enhanced Programme Showcase ⭐ HIGH PRIORITY
**Problem:** Programme cards are basic and don't convey the unique value of each service.

**Solutions:**
- Add hero images to programme cards (not just detail pages)
- Include key benefits/outcomes as visual badges or icons
- Add hover effects with more detail/imagery
- Create unique visual treatments using each programme's accent colour
- Add "At a glance" stats (e.g., "Suitable for: KS1-2" or "Session length: 45-60 mins")

**Impact:** Immediately makes the core services more appealing and understandable

---

### 2. Dynamic Homepage Hero ⭐ HIGH PRIORITY
**Problem:** Current hero is functional but lacks visual excitement.

**Solutions:**
- Add a hero image carousel/slider showing sessions in action
- Include rotating statistics or key facts
- Add subtle animations (fade-ins, parallax effects)
- Make the three programme highlights more visually distinct
- Add a "scroll to explore" indicator

**Impact:** First impression becomes memorable and engaging

---

### 3. Social Proof & Credibility ⭐ HIGH PRIORITY
**Problem:** No testimonials, case studies, or evidence of impact.

**Solutions:**
- Add testimonials section (from teachers/schools/parents)
- Include "Impact by Numbers" section with stats:
  - Schools partnered with
  - Pupils supported
  - Sessions delivered
  - Years of experience
- Add school/organization logos (if applicable)
- Include "Trusted by schools across Greater Manchester" messaging

**Impact:** Builds trust and demonstrates proven results

**Solutions:**
- Add pull quotes highlighting key messages
- Use larger, bolder headings for key sections
- Add background patterns/shapes for visual interest
- Use programme accent colours more prominently throughout sections
- Add dividers, borders, or visual breaks between sections

**Impact:** Easier to scan, more engaging to read

### 5. Enhanced Programme Detail Pages

- Include qualifications/certifications visually
- Add a "Meet the team" video placeholder (for future)

**Impact:** Humanizes the service, builds connection

### 7. Interactive Elements & Micro-interactions

- Parallax effects on hero sections
- Progress indicators for multi-step content
- Animated programme accent colour transitions

**Impact:** Modern, polished feel; increases engagement time

### 8. Stronger Call-to-Actions

**Solutions:**

- Include phone number as click-to-call on mobile
- Add "Quick Contact" floating widget

**Impact:** Increases conversion rate

### 9. "Why Choose Learning Through Motion" Section

**Solutions:**
- Create dedicated section highlighting unique approach:

  - Two-coach model
  - EHCP-aligned
  - In-school delivery (convenience)
  - Cross-curricular integration
  - Proven impact
- Use icons or illustrations for each point
- Add comparison messaging (gentle, not negative about others)

**Impact:** Clearly positions LTM as the best choice

---

### 10. Better Mobile Experience
**Problem:** Mobile is functional but could be more engaging.

**Solutions:**
- Larger tap targets
