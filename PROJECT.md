# Learning Through Motion

## Overview

Learning Through Motion is a SEND (Special Educational Needs and Disabilities) focused educational service that delivers cross-curricular learning through movement, sport, and sensory experiences. The organisation is based in Bolton and works with schools across Greater Manchester and Lancashire.

**Tagline:** Growing Towards Independence

## Mission & Vision

The vision is to create a future where children with special educational needs and disabilities are empowered to learn, grow, and thrive through sport. By integrating cross-curricular learning into active sessions, every child is met where they are and supported in an environment that suits their individual needs and learning style.

**Core Belief:** Every child deserves the chance to succeed - in their own way, at their own pace, and in an environment that celebrates who they are.

## Three Core Programmes

### 1. Maths Through Sport
**Colour accent:** `#0f6d63` (teal)

Transforms maths learning by embedding core concepts into movement, games, and sporting activities. Children develop counting, addition, measurement, and problem-solving skills through active challenges that keep them engaged and motivated.

**Target outcome:** Children who may have felt anxious about maths begin to approach it with enjoyment and success.

### 2. Sensory Redevelopment
**Colour accent:** `#c45f24` (orange)

Supports children with SEND and neurodivergent profiles by retraining the sensory nervous system - the foundation for movement, focus, and emotional regulation.

**Core areas:**
- Balance and proprioception (body awareness, coordination, posture)
- Fine motor skills (writing, fastening clothing, handling tools)
- Interoception (recognising internal body signals)
- Regulation strategies (calmness, focus, readiness to learn)

**Target outcome:** Improved focus, calmer behaviour, and stronger building blocks for learning and wellbeing.

### 3. The Next Chapter
**Colour accent:** `#f4c95d` (yellow)

A transition and mentoring programme for Year 7 pupils (particularly SEND/neurodivergent) moving from primary to secondary school. Each student is paired with a dedicated mentor who becomes a trusted face throughout their transition.

**Focus areas:**
- Confidence and self-esteem
- Social connection through inclusive group sessions
- Emotional regulation skills
- Communication and independence

**Target outcome:** A safe, exciting transition to secondary school with strong social, emotional, and sensory foundations.
